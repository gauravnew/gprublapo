"infinite loop"
	Iterate (a) through list of actors
		If (a) is NPC
			If Movable (type 1,2,3)
				if moveto==position
					call NPCEngine's generateNewPosition
				updatePosition()
		If (a) is PC
			if !(moveto==position)
				updatePosition()
				if checkCollision
					if processCollision returns gameover
						set winner
						change gamestate
						break from loop
					transmit health, credits, last class attended
				transmit position
				Iterate (b) through list of actors
					If (b) is PC
						if (a) & (b) within 25 cells of each other using Point2D's getMinDistance
							transmit (a)'s position to (b)
							
Iterate (c) through list of actors
	If PC
		transmit gameover with winner name
Terminate
