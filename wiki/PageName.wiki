#This page contains documentation for the game server.

= Introduction =

The server is based on a level by level design. there are multiple classes in each level and each of them performs functions which are called by classes at higher levels. 

There are three independent subsets of the server code:

  * Networking
  * Database
  * GameLogic

The GameLogic, Database and networking objects are at the same level and call functions withing each other to perform different tasks.


= Details =

The following section gives details about the different parts of the Server and how they relate to the actual server code.

== Networking ==

This sub-section of the code logically contains the following files:
